# CryptoMonitor

The Program was developed like a test task for the job interview. The application is used two APIs CoinGecko and CoinCap, unfortunately, CryptingUp doesn't work now. I would have used only CoinGecko API if the request for the markets branch had worked normally and hadn't thrown an error with code 1020. I'd tried to find information on how to fix it but without any success. So I used CoinCap API to get information about the coins' rank on the home page. If the user often navigates between pages, it brings to requests limit to CoinGecko  API. In general, you can see the program work here: [Video](https://youtu.be/xwxSes-Xgyo). And I'll put some screens below.
